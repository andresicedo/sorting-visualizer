## About this project
<hr>
This project is a visualization of sorting algorithms used in programming.
The sorting algorithms displayed are bubble sort, insertion sort, quick sort and
selection sort. The animations highlight where the values are changing throughout 
the sort, while the speed in which the algorithm is executed is updated by the 
user.

## Challenges Faced
<hr>
The array being sorted is visualized through bars displayed on the screen.
The number value at each array index is passed as the height(%) for each bar.
The main challenge was finding where each algorithm was switching values in 
the array and adding the setTimeout method to that portion of the algorithm 
in order to update the color of that array bar value.

## Additional
<hr>
If you'd like to take this project and make it your own, please feel free to do
so. Below is my main reference for how I learned the different sorting algorithms.
